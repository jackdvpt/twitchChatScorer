# Twitch Chat Scorer

Twitch Chat Scorer is a python script that allows you to view the guesses from chat.
by default it will take every message in chat that begins with !guess and then show that in your thing.
Wait this only works for my friend who i set the thing to oh well.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have python installed (created with version 3.9.14)
- in your terminal run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Running the app

- start app.py
- then in the terminal window it should tell you an url (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080/) go to that url
- You'll see a horrible looking thing but just wait for the green tick to appear. this means your reading chat. From here any messages will appear. you can also add new people sing the top two boxes.
- If you refresh this page you will loose the current chat messages stored so just be careful.
- while the app is running /scoreboard (ie http://127.0.0.1:8080/scoreboard) will show you the active scoreboard. it will scroll down the list if there are too many and also auto refresh after a bit. you can add this into obs and hopefully it works.
